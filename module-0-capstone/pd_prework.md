# Turing Career Development - Mod 0 Capstone

Step 3: Please respond to the following questions in a reflection (4-6 sentences):
   * What is your greatest strength and how do you know?
   My greatest strength is that I am resilient.  I am in my mid 40s.  With that has come many experiences and challenges.  I've never known myself to shy away from a challenge.  I see challenges as opportunities to grow.  I see challenges through until the end; even if the end was not the desired result.  There is still much to gain in that failure.  Learn from your errors and try again!
   * How do you work best?
   I work best when I value and understand the "why" or the "end goal".  I usually like to know the purpose or mission.  Sometimes, the purpose or mission will be unclear at first.  However, it may become clear during or at the end of the mission.  That is the rewarding part!  
   * What is your greatest area of improvement?
   Self Confidence.  While I feel confident at many skills, I may lack confidence in weather or not I'm living a purpose driven life, a meaningful life or a life with intention.  In recent years I've tried to apply the skills I am confident in, to help others.  That seems to give me purpose and meaning.  
   * How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?
   I'll continue to be resilient in my efforts, not just in understanding the challenges of learning how to be a programmer, but also in being a good team mate/co-worker sharing my strengths while also being willing to be on the receiving end of those concepts.
   * How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
   Knowing what my needs are, as well as the needs of others, will allow me to identify the areas that I feel that I could be most beneficial and visa versa.  Another strength is knowing your weaknesses and to be open to allow other's stregnths to rise.


 Step 5: Please respond to the following questions in a reflection (4-6 sentences):
  * What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?
  1.1 Some of the efforts I make to manage my learning process are of course taking notes.  More importantly, re-taking notes.  In other words, re-writing the notes with better handwriting and in an organized matter.  It's also important to make the effort to ask questions when you don't understand something or when you are stuck on a problem.
  1.2 I think the efforts described above are successful.  Are they the only path to success? Absolutely not.  There is a bonus in re-writting notes, as you are literally reviewing the lesson as you re-write!  The bonus in asking questions is that other's will likely benefit from the response.
  1.3  Some challenges that I have found are not being able to take notes fast enough.  It can cause me to miss an important piece of instruction. Sometimes I'll be so interested in the instruction, I'll forget that I should be taking notes!
  * How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
  In regard to Coates' article, the struggle is the norm.  The struggle is always going to be there.  I may not ever "master" coding, for example, but rest assured, I'll always be learning and have the desire to learn.  Now, what stood out to me in Sierra's keynote was the idea of breaking down large pieces of work into small manageable pieces.  Baby steps!
  * What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?
  My emotional state while at Turing, I can imagine, will have its ups and downs.  Accepting that there will be both failure and success in learning is paramount.  Failure can be a discouragement.  That is why it is important to be aware of your emotions and to have a healthy outlet to release those emotions.
  * How will you prepare yourself to be at your best with your learning process while at Turing?
  -Trusting in the process
  -Monitor the process, what adjustments can I make to improve?
  -Be open to new ideas and concepts (not just in learning style)
  -Learn from my peers
